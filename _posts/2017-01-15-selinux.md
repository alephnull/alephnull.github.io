Start by reading the [handbook](https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.selinux.html).

Grub is not used on the cubox so `selinux-activate` will not DTRT. Edit `/etc/default/flash-kernel` to add `selinux=1 ...` to the command line.

Reboot.

It will take a while for the box to come back up. I left it for an hour and came back to find that the box was still not up. Connected via serial console (remember to connect to minicom _before_ powering the cubox on) to find that the boot was hung on some `auditd` messages. I figured that my kernel command line `selinux=1 security=selinux audit=1 enforcing=1` was too ambitious for the first run.

After some googling I came up with the u-boot incantation to boot a Debian kernel by hand:

```
setenv bootargs root=/dev/mmcblk1p1 rootfstype=ext4 ro rootwait console=ttymxc0,115200 console=tty1
ext2load mmc 0:1 0x10800000 /boot/vmlinuz-4.9.0-3-armmp
ext2load mmc 0:1 0x18000000 /boot/dtb-4.9.0-3-armmp
ext2load mmc 0:1 0x18100000 /boot/initrd.img-4.9.0-3-armmp
bootz 0x10800000 0x18100000:${filesize} 0x18000000  
```

`${filesize}` is set by the last ext2load.
